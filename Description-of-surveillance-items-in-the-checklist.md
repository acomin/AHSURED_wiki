# 1. BACKGROUND 
## Describe the context in which the surveillance system specifically operates  
  
### 1.1 Hazard  
Report the hazard targeted by surveillance (a pathogen or other health−threat).
A surveillance system may be multi−hazard, meaning that surveillance activities are designed to target multiple hazards at the same time (parallel design), or that data/samples collected as part of a surveillance activity designed for one specific hazard (mother component) are used to investigate the presence of additional hazards (child components). It should be mentioned if the surveillance of the hazard in question is part of a multi−hazard design, and if there are other surveillance components that the design is dependent upon.   

### 1.2 Geographical area
Describe the geographical area where the surveillance is designed to provide evidence about. 

### 1.3 Susceptible population
Describe the specific animal population susceptible to the hazard in the geographical area of interest.

### 1.4 Historical situation
Describe the historical status of the hazard in the geographical area and population in question. Describe for how long the hazard has/has not been present in the area and population under surveillance. Briefly describe if there has been surveillance in place, and if so, for how long.

### 1.5 Surveillance purpose 
Explain how the information collected is being used to inform policy decisions (e.g. to eradicate or manage the occurrence of disease or inform trade).   
See intermediate (pink) circle in the picture for clarifications. 

![Surveillance Objective](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SVA-SE/AHSURED/master/img/SurvObj.png)  

### 1.6 Surveillance objective 
Clearly state the overarching surveillance objective(s), as a function of the assumed disease situation and surveillance purpose. Refer to the picture above for clarification.  
- **Prevalence estimation**: This objective is appropriate if the target hazard is (thought to be) present in the territory to be covered, and an assessment of the prevalence and or changes in prevalence over time is needed.  
-  **Case detection**: Case detection refers to the search for any animals affected, clinically or not, by the hazard under surveillance. This objective is appropriate if the hazard is present, regardless of whether the hazard occurrence is endemic, epidemic or sporadic, and action will be taken to control disease whenever it is detected.  
- **Early detection**: This objective is appropriate for a situation where the disease is currently absent in the country or region. It may be applied to surveillance for an unknown disease or a known disease considered to pose a non−negligible risk of incursion or emergence. It may also apply to the early stages of an outbreak.  
- **Disease freedom**: This objective is appropriate if the target hazard is thought to be absent in the territory to be covered and the aim is to demonstrate disease freedom for trade or non−trade purposes (e.g. improve public health, to decide when to stop an eradication programme and to eliminate production losses and control costs due to endemic disease). This may apply to diseases which a) have been historically absent, b) have been eradicated and official freedom has been confirmed or c) are thought to be eradicated, but official freedom has not yet been confirmed.   

Surveillance systems may be used to provide information to address several surveillance objectives, but there is usually one that can be considered as primary. If other (secondary) surveillance objectives are relevant, they can be described for the components in question. 

### 1.7 Risk characteristics 
Describe the risk characteristics associated with the hazard distribution and the susceptible population. Risk can be non−uniformly distributed at various level, such as population (particularly geographical and temporal risk factors), herd or animal. Risk characteristics should be described (whether they can be associated with a higher risk of hazard introduction, infection, detection, and/ or consequences).  

### 1.8 Legal requirements & actions taken as a result of finding
Describe the legal support underlying the surveillance, and whether it is a requirement or not to carry out surveillance. Describe also if there are any legal obligations to report, or other requirements (may be associated with quality assurance schemes, declarations for trade etc). Describe what actions are taken in case of a positive result, if any.  
In case of *passive surveillance*, describe the requirements in place for reporting of a suspect case, as well as the procedures for reporting a suspect case (i.e. the steps involved and the methods employed, including how the notification is sent to the authorities), and the procedures following the reporting of a suspect case to the authorities (for example at what stage would/could restrictions be applied to premises or follow up investigations carried out).

### 1.9 Institutions involved & financing  
Mention institutions involved in coordination, field work, laboratory work, financing. Describe the basis for financing.  
Describe who has been responsible for the collection (e.g. veterinarian, farmer, etc.) and analysis (e.g. lab technician, bioinformatician, etc.) of the raw data/samples, official laboratory status, accreditation etc.

### 1.10 Identification of surveillance components  
Identify all the surveillance components belonging to the surveillance system.   
Few examples are:
* active surveillance at farm
* passive clinical surveillance of sheep and goats
* serological testing of boars at insemination centers  
* etc.
   
In case of multi−host hazards or species belonging to multiple production types (e.g. beef, dairy, veal calves), specifically mention the species/production type under surveillance along with the name of the surveillance component (e.g. active surveillance of dairy cattle at farm).   
Document also whether a particular surveillance component has a different surveillance objective, geographical coverage, target species, etc., compared to the overall surveillance system.   

### 1.11 Population strata not covered 
Consider if there are other sectors/strata from the total susceptible population (defined in the surveillance scenario) that are not being covered by all the components the surveillance system together. 

***

# 2. COMPONENT CHARACTERISTICS
## Sections 2 - 9 should be described for each surveillance component separately   
  
### 2.1 Data collection point
Describe where the units of interest can be reached, and therefore where samples will be collected.  
This could be, e.g., at the source (farm, wild life habitat, etc), abattoir, coordination center, artificial insemination center, rendering plants, diagnostic laboratory, markets etc.  

### 2.2 Surveillance approach  
Describe the type of surveillance approach that is used: 
* Survey  
* Continuous data collection  
* Sentinel surveillance 
* Participatory surveillance 
* Indicator−based surveillance 
* Syndromic surveillance

### 2.3 Type of hazard indicator
Describe what outcome is measured for the unit of interest. E.g. Surveillance aimed at antibody detection, pathogen detection, gross pathology, pathology diagnostic (microscopic) or indirect, etc. 

### 2.4 Type of material collected
Describe what is the type of material collected. Examples are clinical reports, blood/serum/plasma, ear notches, tissue (biopsy), tissue (post mortem), milk, semen, urine, feces / fecal swabs, other swabs (not fecal), meat juice, environmental samples or feed, lab testing submissions, social media calls, prescription orders, etc.

### 2.5 Case definition
Specify the criteria to identify a case (i.e. hazard occurrence). For example, *positive serological test result followed by a positive antigen test*. Specify also at which level (animal or herd/flock) the case is defined.  
In case of **passive** or **syndromic surveillance**, outline the requirements, definition or criteria used to identify a suspect case.

***

# 3. TARGET POPULATION
## Describe the target population of a specific surveillance component, which may be a subset of the whole population targeted by the surveillance system.
  
### 3.1 Target criteria
Describe any selection criteria used to choose this particular target population (if the target population for this component is not the entire susceptible population defined for the surveillance system). For example; logistic/convenience; higher probability of infection; higher probability of showing clinical signs; feasibility of detection (the diagnostic tests available can only be used in animals above a certain age, or non−vaccinated animals); or higher severity of consequences in case of infection.  

### 3.2 Population coverage  
Report the proportion of the total susceptible population (defined in the surveillance scenario) covered by the target population defined for this specific component. This could be, for example, the percentage of the cattle population that is dairy for a component focused on dairy cows.

***

# 4. ENHANCEMENTS
## This is **relevant to enhanced−passive surveillance components**, where the collection of surveillance data is observer−initiated. 

### 4.1 Enhancements
Describe any enhancements in place to encourage or facilitate the reporting of notifiable diseases, such as awareness campaigns and monetary or other incentives to reporting.  
Examples are:
* payments or other financial rewards for notifications
* training to increase awareness and recognition of clinical signs
* awareness campaigns to improve recognition of disease and awareness of reporting obligations/procedures. 
* payment of financial compensation for the losses the farmer may incur after a confirmation of notifiable disease 
* provision of alternative routes of reporting such as a phone hotline or notification by SMS
* payment of the testing cost or some other form of mutual agreement such as farmer receiving advice in return
* mandatory/legal obligation to carry out diagnosis of exclusion

***

# 5. TESTING PROTOCOL
## Describe how units have been tested to obtain information about the hazard  

### 5.1 Pooling  
If pooling has been done, describe how and where (field, lab etc).  

### 5.2 Screening / first test  
Describe for the screening test (or sole test if only one is used) which test it is (give the name of the test and manufacturer in case of commercial kits or state if it is an in−house developed test) and any thresholds for considering an animal as positive.  

### 5.3 Confirmatory / second test  
For confirmatory tests (in cases where screening is used), or the second test (when using parallel tests), describe the test to be used, and any thresholds for confirming animals as positive. Also, give the name of the test and manufacturer (for commercial kits) or state if it is an in−house developed test).  

### 5.4. Accuracy of the testing protocol  
Describe what is known about the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the individual tests as well as the Se and Sp of the testing protocol, incl. if tests are applied in series or parallel.

### 7.4 Risk−based allocation 	
If the samples have been allocated based on risk, describe the factors defining the risk strata. For each risk stratum defined, the following information should be reported:
a) risk characteristics: higher probability of infection, detection, consequences etc (revisit section 1.7)
b) percentage of the population that the stratum constitutes
d) relative risks

### 7.5 Sample size 	
The following details should be recorded:
a) sample size calculated at PSU level
b) sample size calculated at SSU level

### 7.6 Sample collection timeline	
Describe how the sampling has been distributed across the study period (sampling plan).

# 8. TIMELINESS 
## Describe the time elapsed from data collection to epidemiological inference and action  

### 8.1 Time from sampling to report	
For surveillance where timeliness is important (early detection, case finding), describe the time needed from sampling to report of confirmed result. This should take into account:
* how often samples are being transferred from the collection site to the lab 
* how often samples have been analysed across the study period (e.g. as soon as received (immediate/real−time); according to a fixed schedule e.g. weekly, monthly; or, in batches after a certain number of samples is reached)
* time for pending results (i.e. time needed for reference testing of a positive screening result)  

### 8.2 Time from confirmation to action 	
For surveillance where timeliness is important (early detection, case finding), describe the time needed from the confirmation of a case to the implementation of actions (eg. control measures).

### 9.2 Test results (per stratum)  
Report the outcome of the testing, by relevant strata and overall.  
Report sampling efforts spatially and temporally, i.e. both for samples that have generated a positive result and samples whose outcome was negative.

### 9.3 Surveillance outcomes (objective dependent)
Provide an assessment of the outcome of surveillance objective in relation to its objective.  
* For **prevalence estimation**, this means prevalence with an accompanying confidence interval.   
* For **case finding**, the outcome of interest is incidence or the detection fraction (proportion of truly infected animals that are detected by the surveillance system).  
* For **freedom studies**, the outcome is probability of freedom, with accompanying design prevalence and confidence level (should be reported at several confidence levels/design prevalences).  
* For surveillance aimed at **early detection**, where no cases have been found, report intensity and relation to risk−based sampling activities.
